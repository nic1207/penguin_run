uSky 1.1.5 Change Log
=======================
- Added new uFogGradient script. It is simple gradient color setting that based on the Timeline for unity stardard fog color, nothing fancy. 
It works well for forward rendering path. It has predefined sky color gradient keys, and user can manually change the fog color with any custom sky color.
This script is useful for some case: transparent material, the objects are not in the Z-buffer, the unity water that use the stardard fog..etc.
To use it: just simply apply this script to uSkyManager and turn on the Fog in the Lighting window. 
Note: It does NOT need uSkyFogCamera to apply on Main Camera.

- Added night sky rotation feature. If the night sky rotation enabled, the moon will be opposite direction of the sun, also the stars and outer space will rotate at night as well.
 
- Fixed the incorrect default value of "Cloud Texture Scale" in uSkymapRenderer script.

- Fixed the error of uSkymap shader for not completely initialized when compiled in PC.

- Fixed the Star intensity keep getting brigther when undo the uSkyManager.

- Changed the uSkyFog "Density" slider to higher maximum value. The range is now from 0.0001 to 1.


uSky 1.1.4 Change Log
=======================
- Added Scattering Fog image effect. Please read the documentation for more detail.

- Disconnect the Ground color from uSkyMananger with ambient Ground Color gradient. (It was connected in last version v1.1.3f4)
This allow user to set skybox ground color indepenently. For instance skybox has a dark blue ground color as ocean color, 
the ambient ground gradient has default grey color for the scene ambient lighting.
( Other ambient gradient colors in uSkyManager attributes will remain connected with scene ambient.)

- Fixed "Hemisphere_Mesh.fbx" Rectangular UVs. Less bunched up artefact at the top of the sky. (Thanks for user: Seith) 

- Tweaked the Sunset fall off rate. It is slightly smoother when skybox day color is fading to sunset color.

- Tweaked with less color saturation for the Distance cloud in Linear Color Space.n
 

uSky 1.1.3f4 Change Log
=======================
*********************************************************************************************************
NOTE:  THIS UPDATE VERSION WILL SUPPORT UNITY 5 ONLY! DO NOT INSTALL IN UNITY 4!
*********************************************************************************************************

- Added "namespace uSky" in scripts to prevent conflicts with other third-party code. 
To access the uSky script other then uSkyManager from your custom script that just simply add "using uSky" (with capital "S").

- Added new Unity 5 GUI demo and GUI prefabs.

- Added Tooltip in all the attributes in uSkyManager.

- Improved the Distance cloud supports multiple cameras with different distance far clipping planes. For instance, the main camera far clipping planes is 1500,
Reflection probe camera far clipping planes is 400, now they are all render the cloud properly as expected.
Note: In Unity 5, If you switch Scene window shading mode to "Wireframe", you will see a small hemisphere mesh (it is for the cloud) at zero position of the world. 
It is completely normal, when you switch back shading mode to "Shade", it will be gone and everything render as normal.

- Optimized the uSkyLight script and improved Ambient gradient setting, the uSkyManager color setting of day time will affect the gradient output for ambient color.
  Also they can be easily reset from the upper corner "gear" icon.

- Improved the rayleigh scattering setting. Balanced the color and brightness when the rayleigh value is more than one.

- Fixed and clean up unnecessary garbage collect cause by "string" of the shader keyword codes in uSkyManager. 

- When apply new uSkyManager to a new scene, uSkyManager will try to find the "Directional Light" and automatically attach it as the sun Light.

- Removed the "Ambient Intensity" setting. It was more usefull for Unity 4. However in Unity 5 you will rarely use it, and 99% situation will stay in value 1.
Of course user can still change it in Ligthing window setting. 

- Changed the Longitude Range from (0 ~ 360) to (-180 ~ 180).

- Since this version is not supporting Unity 4 anymore. Some of the uSky codes have been clean up for Unity 5. 
It won't get API update message in Editor when import uSky.

- The uSky folders hierarchy has been Rearranged.



uSky 1.1.2 Change Log
=======================

*********************************************************************************************************
NOTE:  THIS WILL BE THE LAST VERSION THAT SUPPORT UNITY 4, NEXT UPDATE VERSION WILL SUPPORT UNITY 5 ONLY!
*********************************************************************************************************

- Changed "Night Zenith Color" color setting to gradient. That give user total control the night sky color from sunset to mid night. 
Now default night sky color is slightly darker.

- In Unity 5, Reflection of the skybox Outer Space cubemap has been enabled. Especially when user set the "Outer Space intensity" to very high or apply a bright custom galaxy cubemap that 
it will be reflected in the reflection probe as expected. 

- Added alternative "Distance Cloud Cheap" shader renders just simple flat shading for the cloud, it has been optimized for mobile usage.
If The cloud color get too dark when applied Camera Tonemapping in Gamma Color Space, check the "Bypass sRGB Sampling" from cloud texture import settings

- Improved "Distance cloud" material will always stay color correctly in Unity 4 Editor even if it is not in focus.

- Improved automatic detection for color space when the color space has changed. Now all sky settings will get refresh and switch to correct color.



uSky 1.1.1 Change Log
=======================
- Changed the "Sky Tint" color setting to shift wavelenghts range directly instead of multiply the existing sky color. 
The skybox shader has slightly less calculation. Now the neutral value of "Sky Tint" is grey color (128).

- Added bonus "uSkymap" Renderer for Scrawk's Ocean material ("Ocean BRDF" and "Ocean White Caps"). 
uSkymap will work in Unity 4 (Pro only) and 5. "uSkymapRenderer" will render and apply the uSkymap RenderTexture to the Ocean Material.
Note: This update does not include Scrawk's Ocean project and you need to import it and implement it yourself. If you need help, feel free to ask me.
If you don't need it, feel free to remove "Bonus" folder from your project.

- Distance cloud has own default layerMask at "Layer 18". This setting has not expose in Inspector, but you can change to different layer in the Distancecloud.cs script.
In Unity 5, you can add a name "cloud" to Layer 18, it allows Reflection Probe camera set the "culling mask" that render the cloud layer only, or no render it.

- Fixed some Skybox shader bugs for better "Oculus Rift" support.

- Removed uSkyManager's Skybox Preview in the inspector. It has no cloud preview, so it seems really useless.




uSky 1.1.0f2 Change Log
=======================
- Renamed "Time of day" setting to "Timeline". Avoid naming confusion from other asset package.

- Added "Ambient Gradient" and "Ambient Intensity" that control the RenderSetting Ambient. 
It can be easily manual predefined Ambient Gradient color for different Timeline.
In Unity 4, it will show the Light Color gradient only that will be directly use as RenderSetting Ambient,
This will balance default Light Color (yellowish) and Sky Color (bluish) Ambient lighting even the scene is not using any IBL material.
In Unity 5, Ambient Gradient will be use as ambient color only if "Ambient Source" set to "Gradient" in Lighting window setting.

At the current Unity 5, only Ambient Gradient seems work well for update the ambient in runtime build.
 
- Introduce a new "DistanceCloud beta". It is a sky cloud renderer on the hemisphere mesh. 
Implemented two type of texture mapping of your choice: "Rectangular" and "Polar", both methods can be easily switch within the material setting. 
The cloud color is based on predefined "Light Color" and "Sky color" Ambient Gradient, which not related to skybox color.

In Unity 5 the cloud will automatically render via any reflection probe's camera inside the Editor and Runtime. 
At the moment, the cloud will not render in skybox reflection (from Lighting window setting).
So it only affect the object has reflective material in the scene, will not affect the ambient color lighting.

- Removed "Linear Space" setting, now it will automatically detect the color space and skybox will automatically switch to correct color. 

- Removed the "Density Scale" and "Sunset Time Offset" That combined with single "Rayleigh Scattering" setting. 
It behaves similar to "Atmoshpere Thickness" from the Unity 5 Default-Skybox and behavior now match the description in the documentation.   

- Renamed "Moon Inner Corona Color" to "Moon Inner Corona" and combined "Moon Inner Corona Scale" into the "Moon Inner Corona"s alpha.

- Renamed "Moon Outer Corona Color" to "Moon Outer Corona" and combined "Moon Outer Corona Scale" into the "Moon Outer Corona"s alpha.

- Improved default "Moon Outer Corona Scale" value that now behaves more consistently between Linear/Gamma space and when Tonemapping is using.

- The Sun and Moon Light will auto Enable/Disable when it has no affect to the scene lighting. 

- Since Unity 5 Beta 22 ligthing changed, so uSkyLight changed the default value of sun intensity from 0.5 to 1.0, and default moon intensity from 0.1 to 0.4.

- Changed Color correction of the Skybox in linear space that it uses power of 2.0 now instead of 2.2. Slightly more peformance friently.

- Changed default "Star Intensity" value from 2 to 1, and the default Star flickering speed is little bit slower as well.

- Since Unity 5 fixed the skybox preview with linear color space issue, now preview has been enabled for unity 5.

- Default Sun Size is slightly smaller now.



uSky 1.0.1 Change Log
=======================
- Renamed Component "uSkyRenderer" to "uSkyManager".

- Added "Time Of Day" and "Longitude" sliders to control the full Day/Night cycle of the sun rotation.

- Added new "uSkyLight" script to manage the Sun and Moon lighting in the scene. Single editable "Gradient" to control the full Day/Night cycle of both Sun and Moon light color.
It included two sliders to control Sun and Moon intensity. 

- Added new Night Sky with "Moon", "Star Field" and "Outer Space Cubemap". Also added new Night Sky Parameters in uSkyManager.
Included the MilkyWay Cubemap that match up with stars position of "Star Field".

- Now the uSky "Exposure" becomes a global lighting exposure control for day time. It will affect final output of the Sun and Moon intensity with uSkyLight.

- Included the Unity 4 "uSky GUI Demo" scene that same as demo webplayer and included the GUI scripts.

- Combined the "Density Scale" and "Altitude Scale" to single "Density Scale" setting from range 0 to 4. 

- New "Night Zenith Color" will replace the "Sunset Zenith Color" through the night sky cycle. It still will affect on the sunset sky color.

- Changed smaller maxmium value of some sliders range and changed default sun is smaller as well.

- Renamed parameter "Directional Light" to "Sun Light".

- Renamed the end of "Wavelength" with "s" for correct spelling, now it is "Wavelengths".

- Updated the documentation.



uSky 1.0.0f2 Change Log
=======================
- Since Unity 5 beta 13 changed for a big and tessellated sphere mesh. Now some codes of uSky shader allows computing per-vertex based for better performance.
New update of the uSky shader that approximately run 10 ~ 20% faster. This performance gain is for Unity 5 beta 13 or newer users only, uSky shader for Unity 4 will remain the same.

* Note: Do not use the uSky shader for Unity 5 in Unity 4.x.x. 

- Removed the Directional Light in the Unity 5 uSkyRenderer Prefab. When apply this Prefab, user need to apply the Directional Light manually to uSkyRenderer.
(When Create or Start a new scene in Unity 5, default always included the Directional Light in the scene. So we removed it from Prefab for less confusion) 

- Small update on the uSkyRenderer.cs, better ground ambient between different color space.


uSky 1.0.0e Change Log
=======================
- Fixed Wavelength setting : the missing _betaR and _betaM values pass to shader.
